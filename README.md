# binance-auto-select-and-trade-bot

In this project that you have implemented using the Binance API, you have selected cryptocurrencies of your choice, for example, LTC-BTC-ETH. By calculating indicators such as EMA on these cryptocurrencies, you predict the most profitable cryptocurrency, make a buy transaction, and then sell when the profit percentage you provided or signals such as EMA indicate a sell opportunity. In cases of sudden drops, you apply stop-loss to prevent losses. To use this project, you will need a constantly running Linux server, which you can get for free on AWS. First, install the required libraries at the beginning of the code. Then, input your Binance API key and values such as the Telegram bot ID. After that, when the program starts, write down the cryptocurrencies you want to trade, for example, LTC BTC, and then select your stable coin, such as USDT. Finally, run the bot, and it will send you messages via Telegram as it performs trades.

Now, here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. Install necessary libraries mentioned at the beginning of the code.
2. Input your Binance API key and other required values such as the Telegram bot ID.
3. Write down the cryptocurrencies you want to trade. For example, you can input "LTC BTC" to trade Litecoin against Bitcoin.
4. Select your stable coin, such as USDT, which will be used as a base currency for trading pairs.
5. Run the bot on a Linux server (e.g., AWS) to keep it constantly running.
6. The bot will start performing trades based on calculated indicators like EMA and will send you messages via Telegram to keep you updated about the trades.
7. The bot will automatically sell the cryptocurrency either when the provided profit percentage is achieved or when sell signals, like EMA-based signals, indicate a suitable time to sell.
8. In cases of sudden drops, the bot will apply a stop-loss mechanism to prevent excessive losses and protect your funds.
